Hi I'm Young!

I'm an engineering leader with 20 years experience focused on building teams and scaling orgs across startup and corporate environments. Experienced across the entire software stack from web to mobile and data infra to dev ops. I've worked across various industries including consumer electronics, saas (enterprise/smb) and consumer software. 

I am passionate about building products, teams and diverse cultures.

I hope you enjoy this little space on the internet for various thoughts and learnings that I have to share. Feel free to reach out to connect on LinkedIn or Twitter (links in the footer).

Thanks!
